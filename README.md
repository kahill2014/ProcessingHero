# ProcessingHero
This project was intended to be a guitar hero clone, but things didn't go quite as planned so it was turned into a 
simple guitar that plays 4 notes.

NOTE: Some of the code included does not have a functionality, but was generated in an effort to create the first 
concept for the final product. I've left them in case anyone wants to try to fiddle with them to see if they can make it work.
